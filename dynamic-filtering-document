# dynamic-filtering-rest

we define different filters for different services, according to need.
Suppose there are three fields: name, phone, and salary. We want to send two fields: name and salary for the first service and name and phone for the second service.
To implement dynamic filtering, we use a class named MappingJacksonValue. 

Step 1: Open FilteringController.java file.
Step 2: Create a constructor of MappingJacksonValue class and pass a bean (someBean) as a constructor argument.
MappingJacksonValue mapping = new MappingJacksonValue (someBean);  

Step 3: To configure the filters.FilterProvider is an abstract class. It has a single implementation of the SingleFilterProvider method. 
Invoke the addFilter() method that has two parameters String id and SimpleBeanPropretyFilter filter

FilterProvider filters=new SimpleFilterProvider().addFilter("SomeBeanFilter", filter);

Step 4: Invoke the static method filterOutAllExcept() of the class SimpleBeanPropertyFilter class. 
It filters all the fields in response except the fields which we have specified. 

SimpleBeanPropertyFilter filter=SimpleBeanPropertyFilter.filterOutAllExcept("name", "salary");  

Step 5: Configure the filters.

mapping.setFilters(filters);  

step 6: return mapping
step7:return type of the method to MappingJacksonValue.
Step 8: Open SomeBean.java file and define a filter by using the annotation @JsonFilter.
